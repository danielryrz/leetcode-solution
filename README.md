# leetcode-solution

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, written in Python.  
Each solution includes an explanation of the approach, complexity analysis, and sometimes multiple methods (brute force, optimized).

## Structure
- Problems are grouped by topic (arrays, dynamic programming, graphs, etc.)
- Each solution is named by its LeetCode problem number and title.

## Example
`array/0055_jump_game.py` â†’ Contains code and explanation for LeetCode #55 (Jump Game).

## Goals
- Learn and understand patterns in solving coding problems 
- Practice for coding interviews
- Build a strong problem-solving portfolio
- Share knowledge with others

## LeetCode problems solved and linked
### Array Problems


- [Jump Game I (#55)](arrays/0055_jump_game.py)  
  Greedy solution with explanation.

- [Jump Game II (#45)](arrays/0045_jump_game_II.py)  
  - Version 1: Minimum jump count (efficient greedy).  
  - Version 2: Minimum jump count + path reconstruction.
